# Ex.No: 11  PLANNING â€“  BLOCK WORLD PROBLEM

### DATE:                                                                            

### REGISTER NUMBER : 212221040011

### AIM: 
     To find the sequence of plan for Block World problem using PDDL  
     
###  ALGORITHM:

     Step 1 :  Start the program.
     
     Step 2 : Create a domain for Block world Problem.
     
     Step 3 :  Create a domain by specifying predicates clear, on table, on, arm-empty, holding.
     
     Step 4 : Specify the actions pickup, putdown, stack and un-stack in Block world problem.
     
     Step 5 :  In pickup action, Robot arm pick the block on table. Precondition is Block is on table and no other block on specified block and arm-hand empty.
     
     Step 6:  In putdown action, Robot arm place the block on table. Precondition is robot-arm holding the block.
     
     Step 7 : In un-stack action, Robot arm pick the block on some block. Precondition is Block is on another block and no other block on specified block and arm-hand empty.
     
     Step 8 : In stack action, Robot arm place the block on under block. Precondition is Block holded by robot arm and no other block on under block.
     
     Step 9 : Define a problem for block world problem.
     
     Step 10 : Obtain the plan for given problem.
     
### PROGRAM:

### BLOCK WORLD.PDDL

     (define (domain blocksworld) 
     (:requirements :strips :equality) 
     (:predicates (clear ?x) 
     (on-table ?x) 
     (arm-empty) 
     (holding ?x) 
     (on ?x ?y)) 
     (:action pickup 
     :parameters (?ob) 
     :precondition (and (clear ?ob) (on-table ?ob) (arm-empty)) 
     :effect (and (holding ?ob) (not (clear ?ob)) (not (on-table ?ob))  
     (not (arm-empty)))) 
     (:action putdown 
     :parameters  (?ob) 
     :precondition (and (holding ?ob)) 
     :effect (and (clear ?ob) (arm-empty) (on-table ?ob)  
     (not (holding ?ob)))) 
     (:action stack 
     :parameters  (?ob ?underob) 
     :precondition (and  (clear ?underob) (holding ?ob)) 
     :effect (and (arm-empty) (clear ?ob) (on ?ob ?underob) 
     (not (clear ?underob)) (not (holding ?ob)))) 
     (:action unstack 
     :parameters  (?ob ?underob) 
     :precondition (and (on ?ob ?underob) (clear ?ob) (arm-empty)) 
     :effect (and (holding ?ob) (clear ?underob) 
     (not (on ?ob ?underob)) (not (clear ?ob)) (not (arm-empty)))))

### INPUT

### PROBLEM-1.PDDL
      
     (define (problem pb1) 
     (:domain blocksworld) 
     (:objects a b) 
     (:init (on-table a) (on-table b)  (clear a)  (clear b) (arm-empty)) 
     (:goal (and (on a b))))     

### PROBLEM-2.PDDL

     (define(problem pb3) 
     (:domain blocksworld) 
     (:objects a b c) 
     (:init (on-table a) (on-table b)   (on-table c)   
     (clear a)  (clear b) (clear c) (arm-empty)) 
     (:goal (and (on a b) (on b c))))

### OUTPUT/PLAN:

### PROBLEM-1.PDDL
![Experiment - 11](https://github.com/AKASHBKUMAR/AI_Lab_2023-24/assets/113763258/a3127337-087c-4a6c-870f-98403851f942)

### PROBLEM-2.PDDL
![Experiment - 11 - 2](https://github.com/AKASHBKUMAR/AI_Lab_2023-24/assets/113763258/15854214-5d8d-4994-9d1e-793690d9b64e)


### RESULT:
     Thus, the plan was found for the initial and goal state of Block World problem.
